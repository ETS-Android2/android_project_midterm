## Features
This project is a Covid-19 tracker app made in Java. The main function is to keep tracks of covid cases and vaccinated numbers
* Global cases, active, deaths, recovered 
* Search country based on their name
* View specific country with its covid number
* Pie chart to display covid cases and line chart to display vaccinated numbers
* Map for someone who wants to visualize covid cases. We use google map API
